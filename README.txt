Thank you for looking over this project. 

In order to run this project, download the repo to a workspace. 

If you do NOT have NODE.js on your computer, download it here https://nodejs.org/en/download/
  Also install NPM (Node Package Manager) on the command line with npm-install.
  
  
 If you do have, or have just installed NODE.js. You can run this program from a console with command "node planets.js". 
 To go over tests, run command "npm run test."
 
 If you are having issues with the tests, run "npm install jest." You shouldn't need to do this due to package-JSON, but if it was not downloaded correctly this may help.
